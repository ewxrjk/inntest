INN Test Utilities
==================

This is a test system for INN.  It's not very complete yet.

1. Create 'tnews' user and group.

2. Edit the diffs to reflect your local configuration.  You'll need a
   known-good news swerver on the same box to peer with.

3. Edit 'config' to meet your local settings.

4. Run 'test-all' to build and test INN.
