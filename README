INN Test Utilities
==================

This is a test system for INN.  It's not very complete yet.

1. Edit 'config' to meet your local settings.

2. Create 'tnews' user and group.  (You can select a different name in
   config.)

3. Run 'test-all' to build, install and test INN.

4. Alternatively run 'build' to build it and then indidivual test
   scripts to install and test with particular configurations:
     test-innfeed          - default test configuration
     test-nntpsend         - test with nntpsend and buffindexed overview

If anything goes wrong and you can't see why, consult *.log files.
